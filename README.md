This app was made with the intention of linking builds taken from False-Spring's [`GBFR-Logs`](https://github.com/false-spring/gbfr-logs) into Maygi's [`Relink Damage Calculator`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RnNLfdqFCW7zWvfHnQsNRJoi7EtIjdOUg-uYB0xsZHQ/edit#gid=1519714141)

This app also needs help with localizations ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ
